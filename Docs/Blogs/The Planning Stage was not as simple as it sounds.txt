After many discussions of what we were going to do with our sponsor as well as our supervisor we decided to plan out exactly what we were going to do and how we will go about it. Immediately we hit an issue as we didn't know what type of character/avatar to design for this project so that we could limit the mouth movement (lip-syncing is extremely hard to do so we thought it was best to avoid it at this stage). Many ideas then came to mind, what about a block-style character like the ones in Minecraft? But then that's not too original nor does it represent the actual user very well. What about a robotic figure? That would definitely eliminate the mouth movement however the issue here is that it would in no way represent the look of the user. We overcame this by providing many different avatar designs and decided to settle on a simple human-like figure and maybe have the mouth go from a line to a closed circle as if he was speaking whenever he speaks.

Another thing we had to sort out from the very start were IBM Cloud accounts as using those is a vital part in the project. This wasn't hard to do, however then we had to figure out where the Watson services were and had to track down which of its services we would need to use.

One other thing that we needed to take into account is the fact that we would in no way get this interface working for every single CV/Resume in the world... I mean that would take years, right? So we decided to settle on making it based of off John's Resume, which also resulted in us needing to extract specific information for it so that we included the majority of the things that need to be in there. Therefore this resulted in us planning as to how this resume will look like and what sections it will contain.

The list just goes on and on, I could sit here for hours talking about every little thing that we planned as believe me, there was a lot of it! However, I don't want to bore you by listing everything and just wanted to cover the main points and challenges we faced as well as how we overcame them.

The next step as you can imagine is actually delving into the project and start turning our plans into reality, I don't know about you but that excites me! Thinking about it, there will be a lot more challenges over the course of this project but I mean, it's all worth it at the end of the day and we will definitely have good fun creating this!
