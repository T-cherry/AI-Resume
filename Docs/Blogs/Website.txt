Now building a website seems like a pretty decent job since what we need for our project isn't too complex. For the most part building the website went smoothly as anticipated, the html files were all pretty easy to write alongside the css for the website. This is what we like to see; a project that's going well without any major issues/complications, however when it came to implementing node.js for several components for the website life started getting a whole lot more <strong>difficult</strong>.

<strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>json</strong> files were used for the website to get it to run on the server, as well as so that we could incorporate the Watson conversion service in it. To do this we had to find the service credentials for our Watson conversation and place them in the right document on the js file. This sounds like a basic task, however this took quite a while to get to work. Even though we were following the instructions, it took 3 of our team members an average of 3 hours to figure it out. The main issue here was that we had to name a file .env (nothing before it), which seemed to have confused the computer and no matter what we did it just wasn't working. In the end, we managed to get the files to work and we managed to get the website to work on the localhost server.

Another part that we had to integrate into the website was John's resume. We decided that rather than having it on the same page as the conversation service (it would be too packed) we were going to get it to open in a different tab as a <strong>pdf file</strong> as that way it would look a lot more <strong>professional</strong> and <strong>clean</strong>. We placed an image in the form of a button, which in fact was a hyperlink on the page linking to the pdf version of the resume. To do this we used pdf.js, which seemed like it was going to be the best way for this, however the pdf opened on a different port to our website, which once again was <strong>not</strong> <strong>ideal. </strong>On top of this, the hyperlink didn't work on one mouse click, to open it you had to right click and select 'Open in a new tab'. Let's just say that at this point we were left scratching our heads...

We didn't quite understand why the issues were occurring but after a short while one of our team members realised that the <em>target = "_blank", </em>which is the code that lets you open the document in another tab was just misplaced so we managed to quickly fix that issue.Great! One issue down, now we had the other one to face. We kept googling and googling and yet we couldn't find anywhere or anyone with some sort of solution to our issue. At this point we decided to look at other ways we could get the resume to open as a pdf in another tab and we stumbled upon <strong>pdfobject</strong>, which is just another method for this. We implemented it and guess what.. <strong>it worked! </strong>

It opens as a pdf and is run on the same port as the website.[/caption]

Let's just say that building this website was a lot more difficult than anticipated however we managed to get there in the end! The next step is to finish the avatar and integrate it into the website... I'll discuss this process in an avatar post that will feature later on!
