Repository for use in the IBM AI-Resume project

AI-Resume(Group 18)

Project No.2 

What is this project about: 

This project which is sponsored by IBM, is to create an application which combines several different aspects to allow an Employer to interact with resumes via text and speech. For this project we will be using Watson text-to-speech, speech-to-text services as well as: Unity, cinema4D, nodeRed.js and Watson personality insights to demonstrate how this could be done one resume as an example. 

The main purpose of the interaction is to allow the employer to ask questions to an avatar shown onscreen via a chat dialog by either typing requests or using a microphone to verbally ask the avatar. The avatar will be powered by the Watson conversation service and therefore will be able to respond to queries and provide information about the resume and give guidance as to which sections to refer to. The drive behind this is to make the reviewing of resumes easier and more interesting for an employer and to allow a deeper understanding of an applicant.

To note: 
Use of watson conversation service and other IBM apllications use the IBM BlueMix/cloud platform for development. This has meant we can work together on the services without uploading to a shared repository such as github. Therefore the uploads that are present in the waston_conversation branch are the lastest incremental copies of our collabrative work. We were made aware by our supervisor that we should upload a version everynow and then and hence thsi is what we have started to do, therefore collabrative work may not be as clear on Github but this has been happening. 
As well as this the understanding and research into these new services took some time and therefore delaying real physical progress being made at the beggining of the project as we all first had to familarise ourselves with the Bluemix platform and tools.
